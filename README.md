# Real-time Currency Converter with Python
To create a real-time currency converter in Python, you can use an API to get the latest exchange rates. One of the popular choices is the ExchangeRate-API, which provides free and paid plans for accessing real-time exchange rates.

Here's a step-by-step guide to building a simple currency converter using Python and the ExchangeRate-API:

Sign up for an API Key:
Go to the ExchangeRate-API website and sign up for a free API key.

Install the required packages:
You will need the requests package to make HTTP requests to the API. If you don't have it installed, you can install it using pip
Run the script:
Replace "your_api_key_here" with the API key you received from ExchangeRate-API. Then run the script and follow the prompts to convert currencies.
This script will fetch the latest exchange rates from the ExchangeRate-API and use them to convert the specified amount from one currency to another.

Note: Make sure to handle API usage limits and errors appropriately in a production environment. This example script provides a basic implementation to get you started.
